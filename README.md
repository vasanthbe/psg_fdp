- This pacakge has lesser bandwidth, uses non-ASCII for data exchange.

Usage

- Codes under Arduino can be dumped into any Aruino based hardware.

- If any other hardware which is in need of different type RS232 / Serial protocol interface, Openinterface under ros/src code has to be modified to link to support,

License

- GPL license applicable.


All the best :-)
